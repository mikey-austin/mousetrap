    mousetrapd - Log monitoring and active response daemon

SYNOPSIS
      mousetrapd [options]

      Options:
        --daemon               start as a daemon
        --user=<user>          user to setuid to
        --group=<group>        group to setgid to
        --pidfile=<pidfile>    location of the pidfile
        --config=<config>      path to configuration file
        --help                 print help and exit
        --version              print version and exit

DESCRIPTION
    This program monitors multiple file sources as specified in the
    configuration file and executes arbitrary actions based on the frequency
    of observer "events".

    An event is a captured string extracted out of a line from a log file.
    For example, if the following source was configured in the mousetrapd
    configuration file:

      my_iptables_source: {
        file:    '/var/log/kern.log',
        pattern: 'audit out smtp .+ UID=(\d+)',
        index:   0,
        action:  'iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner %L -j DROP'
      }

    a unique match of the value of the group above (ie \d+) is considered an
    event. So to illustrate further, if the following line was observed in
    /var/log/kern.log with the configured "pattern" above:

      IPTABLES - audit out smtp IN= OUT=eth0 ... UID=12333 ...

    the "event" is considered an occurance of "12333". A limit of event
    occurances per time period is configured, along with a threshold. If a
    particular event exceeds this limit, an arbitrary command configured
    against the source is executed, with '%L' substituted for the event. In
    the example above, the following command would be executed:

      iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner 12333 -j DROP

SIGNALS
    The mousetrapd daemon will catch the HUP signal, reload the
    configuration that the daemon was started with, and restart all source
    watcher child processes.
